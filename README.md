# Oxford Hack 2020 - MATLAB, Unity Game, and Augmented Reality

# View our MATLAB application source codes!

  • **Backend** - The logic and backend of the Unity Game + WebGL

# View our Unity Game application source codes!

  • **Unity** - User-interactive assembly of the components within the circuit
  
  • **Frontend** - Layout of the Unity WebGL with directions + the game


# View the AR visualization of the components!

  • **components** - AR visualization of the components in the circuit with a resistor
  
  • **components2** - AR visualization of the components in the circuit with a bulb
  
  
# How we tackled the selected challenges

  • **MathWorks** - developed simulations and logic of circuit with MATLAB & Simulink and combined it with a Unity Game developed on Unity
                    and displayed using Unity WebGL
  
  • **echoAR** - utilized echoAR by generating models, importing them into Reality Composer, and assembling them for a clear visualization
                 of the required components in a circuit (resistor/bulb)
